CMIP is a project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)â€™s Working Group of Coupled Modelling (WGCM). Since 1995, CMIP has coordinated climate model experiments involving multiple international modeling teams worldwide. leading to a better understanding of past, present and future climate change and variability in a multi-model framework. The central goal is to advance scientific understanding of the Earth system.
CMIP defines common experiment protocols, forcings and output, and has developed in phases, the current being the sixth phase, CMIP6. CMIP model simulations have also been regularly assessed as part of the IPCC Climate Assessments Reports and various national assessments.
